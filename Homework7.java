/*
Homework 6 and this additional functionality.

When you have the string ask for the which index of the word in the sentence you want to print out.

Example:
Please enter the sentence:

Hello    this is a text with lots of    spaces.

Please enter the order of the sentence.

if we enter 2 it will print the "this"
if we enter 111 it will print the "sentence does not have this much of words."
if we enter negative or 0  it will print error message.

Note that we can enter lots of spaces... Still it should be smart enough to understand.



exit when you write done...


Ask for index.

Hint: Integer.parseInt can be used to do the second part (entering the order of the sentence)
