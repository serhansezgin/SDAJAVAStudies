     *
     * Problem : So far we worked with one/ two tables.
     * What if we have hundreds of tables and relationships between them
     * How many code lines do we need to write?
     * How easy/hard would be to manage and keep track what query does what ?
     *
     * Java is OOP world. Have you realized we did not use any object!!!
     *
     * What's the solution ?
     * Hibernate!
     *
     * Hibernate is an Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) solution for Java environments.
     *
     * The term ORM refers to the technique of mapping data
     * between an object model representation to a relational data model representation.
     *
     * It can significantly reduce development time otherwise
     * spent with manual data handling in SQL and JDBC.
