     * What is Hibernate?
     *
     *  - Hibernate is ORM (object-relational mapping) tool for the Java programming language.
     *  - It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database.
     *
     *  JDBC has advantages if your application is small
     *  If you don't have any associations between your tables/entities
     *
     *  If your db is big and if we don't have ORM we will do all redundant
     *  conversion operation by coding.
     *
     *  As java is oop language and to oop language features, orm frameworks really
     *  help us to map our objects & entities/tables and work with them together
     *
     * - Hibernate also supports relationships
     * - It supports collections
     * - In jdbc we only have checked exceptions
     * - In hibernate only unchecked exceptions
     * - Hibernate has capability to generate primary keys
     * - Hibernate has HQL contains database independent commands
     * - Hibernate supports caching mechanism
     *
     * Disadvantages
     * - A lot to learn :(
     * - Hibernate is slower than pure JDBC as
     * it is generating lots of SQL statements in runtime.
     * - Hibernate is not suitable for Batch processing
