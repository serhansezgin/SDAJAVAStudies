     *    Before you develop, let's read a story...
     *
     *    - You are a part of Loan development team of x bank.
     *    - On monday, your task is... calculate fee regarding of customer account type
     *    - So before implementing calculation part, you think you need a representation of
     *    account, so you created Account class with these variables :
     *
     *      -  Account number
     *      -  Customer
     *      -  Balance
     *      -  Account type
     *
     *    So far so good, you created an Account class and you implemented calculation part,
     *    you write your test cases...
     *
     *    Next monday you got your new task :
     *
     *    We need to add branch info and interest rate because requirements changed,
     *    our business team thinks we need more info for calculating.
     *
     *    So you added these two variables to Account class :
     *
     *       - Branch info
     *       - Interest rate
     *
     *   You updated all test cases.
     *
     *   Finally this monday you are expecting to get a new task. However our business
     *   team realized that they need to bring up Currency area in order to calculate
     *   account fees.
     *
     *     - Currency
     *
     *   Unfortunately, this scenario is not a joke either fiction.
     *
     *   So please create an Account class with Builder pattern!
     *
     *
     *
